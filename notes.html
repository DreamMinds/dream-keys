  <h1>Field Notes: Prague 1967–1969</h1>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #004 – Initial Symbol Induction</div>
    <p>
      Trials with subjects exposed to card imagery prior to sleep suggest subconscious pattern sensitivity. Card #7 ("The Staircase of Red Birds") produced recurring dream themes across participants, notably references to "counting" and "ascending." May indicate partial symbolic encoding.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #009 – Group Dream Correlation</div>
    <p>
      Three subjects reported numeric sequences in the same dream cycle after focusing on Card #13 ("The Window with No View"). Numbers were inconsistent but clustered around mid-deck values. Further control testing planned.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #021 – Link to Remote Viewing</div>
    <p>
      A visiting U.S. liaison mentioned similarity to early remote cognition experiments. Possible crossover interest from defense sector. Ethics concerns raised, but no official inquiry. Keep notes vague in final report.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #034 – Mirror and Spiral Stimulation</div>
    <p>
      Subjects exposed to alternating spiral and mirror imagery exhibited increased theta wave activity. One subject described a "humming oval" in their dream matching the induction symbol. Others reported being "watched" from behind their own reflections.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #047 – Audio Loop (Red Door Protocol)</div>
    <p>
      Subjects were played a whisper loop of the phrase “find the red door” beneath white noise. Four reported encountering a red door within dream sequences — often at the end of distorted hallways. One claimed: “It wouldn't open until I spoke.”
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #053 – Chessboard Projection (Discontinued)</div>
    <p>
      An experimental chess set with altered rules was placed beside sleeping participants. Subjects who memorized game states reported dreams of self-competition. No strategic consistency. The project was retired due to ambiguous results and high subject frustration.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #059 – Fractal Overlay Hypnosis</div>
    <p>
      Projection of a prime-based fractal pattern above the bed led to architectural dreamscapes — subjects spoke of nested rooms, recursive stairwells, and “houses within houses.” One sketched a room he claimed was “infinitely folding inward.”

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Entry #063 – Non-Card Archetype Trigger</div>
    <p>
      A velvet envelope containing a single gold thread was given to Participant A before sleep. The next day, they described dreaming of a puppet theater lit from beneath. The puppets were speaking in reversed Czech. No memory of the message remained upon waking.
